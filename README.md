## TESTS

I am new to the testing on front end and have been mostly doing it on backend
in my last experiences so there won't be good tests in this project but have
written very basic and simple tests as I am going through learning more about
test in react front end

To run tests

### `yarn test`

## React and SCSS (SASS)

For developing the task React and Sass have been used.
The code can be improved in alot of ways as some repeating
code will be found in the project so its not perfect and can
be refactored but for the sake of this task I thought this
will be better enough.
